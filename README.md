**SAM_IoT** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository is dedicated to **experimentation and prototyping with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies**
in the context of SAM workflows.
It provides a sandbox for exploring how real-time or near–real-time data from sensors,
devices, and building systems can be integrated with analytical models.

The content of this repository is exploratory in nature and may evolve rapidly
as different IoT technologies, protocols, and data pipelines are evaluated.

---

## Scope

Typical areas of experimentation include:
- integration of sensor data with SAM analytical models
- ingestion and processing of time-series data
- exploration of IoT protocols and data exchange mechanisms
- coupling of measured data with simulation and analytical workflows

This repository does not represent a stable or production-ready API.
